**Driving Question:** How do designers develop the concept for an *interactive experience* and create testable digital prototypes to refine the design?

*Games* are one type of *interactive experience*, but the principles and skills that we are learning are not exclusive to games and so we do not limit ourselves to games.

**Projects:**

1. **Interactive Card**
1. Side Scroller game
1. Flyer game
1. Collector game
1. **Practice team project**  
Develop skills to work on a team development project.
1. **Collaborative Game Jam**

**Essential Tasks:**

| Activity | Unit 1 | Unit 2 | Unit 3 | Unit 4 | Final |
| :---     | :---   | :---   | :---   | :---   | :---  |
| ET.1: Analyze the effects of developments in computing | Do research towards a "genre poster." |
| ET.2: Design and implement creative solutions and artifacts | 
| ET.3: Apply abstractions and models |  |
| ET.4: Analyze your computational work and the work of others |  |
| ET.5: Communicate computational thought processes, procedures, and results to others |  |
| ET.6: Collaborate with peers on computing activities | Breakdown work & manage project |

By the end of the semester you should be able to:

**ET.1:**  
* Analyze the impact of games in the world, analyze the development of game development tools
  - Describe possible career pathways in game (interactive experience) design and programming.
**ET.2:**  
* Independently implement a prototype for a game of your own design
  - Develop a concept for an interactive experience.
  - Create a digitial prototype to test your core mechanic.
**ET.3:**  
* Represent your game through computational models and abstractions
**ET.4:**  
* Analyze the design of a game and develop a critique if it (as a game, as a design (evidence of craft), and as a "force" in the world (what kind of interactions in the would does the game reward, what "model" of the world does it espouse)
**ET.5:**  
* Document the development of your game designs and share design ideas with team members & stakeholders.
  - Game brief and GDD
  - Research
  - Test plans
**ET.6:**  
* Collaborate on a team to create a game prototype, use industry tools that support collaboration (GitHub, Google Sheets & Docs)

**Associated Skills:**

In completing the essential tasks you will demonstrate these skills:

* Creating and managing shared documents.
* Tracking due dates and managing expectations.
* Working with online services and accounts.
* Reading:
  - Instructions to & tutorials to learn how to do something.
  - Documentation to understand processes & how something is *supposed* to work.
  - Code to understand how something *actually* works.
  - Code to find potential problems & actual bugs.
