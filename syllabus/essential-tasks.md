**Driving Question:** How do designers develop the concept for an *interactive experience* and create testable digital prototypes to refine the design?

*Games* are one type of *interactive experience*, but the principles and skills that we are learning are not exclusive to games and so we do not limit ourselves to games.

**Projects:**

1. **Interactive Card**
1. Side Scroller game
1. Flyer game
1. Collector game
1. **Practice team project**  
Develop skills to work on a team development project.
1. **Collaborative Game Jam**

**Essential Tasks:**

| Activity | Unit 1 | Unit 2 | Unit 3 | Unit 4 | Final |
| :---     | :---   | :---   | :---   | :---   | :---  |
| Analyzing the effects of developments in computing
| Designing and implementing creative solutions and artifacts
| Applying abstractions and models
| Analyzing their computational work and the work of others
| Communicating computational thought processes, procedures, and results to others
| Collaborating with peers on computing activities

By the end of the semester you should be able to:

* Develop a concept for an interactive experience.
* Identify the core mechanic (mode of interaction) used in your concept.
* Create a digitial prototype to test your core mechanic.
* Document your design and the research and testing related to it.
* Collaborate with a diverse team on a project â€“ both in person and electronically.
* Describe possible career pathways in game (interactive experience) design and programming

**Associated Skills:**

In completing the essential tasks you will demonstrate these skills:

* Creating and managing shared documents.
* Tracking due dates and managing expectations.
* Working with online services and accounts.
* Reading:
  - Instructions to & tutorials to learn how to do something.
  - Documentation to understand processes & how something is *supposed* to work.
  - Code to understand how something *actually* works.
  - Code to find potential problems & actual bugs.
