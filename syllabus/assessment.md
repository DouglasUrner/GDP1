## Formative (kind of) Assessments

* Accepted until the *start* of the Unit Project. Since the end of unit assessments, also assess the same standards, if you have not done or submitted these assignments by the start of the end of unit project you will most likely be better off focusing your energy on the project. If you have not completed the skill building practice, you may need to do or at least explore those assignments.

### Skill, Knowledge, and Experience Building Practice

### Vocabulary

Encourage development and use of specialized, domain specific vocabulary.

* Quizes
* Usage when writing and speaking about work

### Concept Tests

Self-checks in each assignment.

Demonstrate the knowedge of key concepts and the ability to explain them. Assignments offer written prompts, concepts may also be demonstrated verbally (at the expense of demonstrating writing standards).

## Unit Summative Assessments

The unit summative assessments are opportunities to put what you have learned into practice. Each assessment is a design project that features the skills and knowledge (including vocabulary) from the unit. These projects are also opportunities to demonstrate improvement in the standards from previous units.
