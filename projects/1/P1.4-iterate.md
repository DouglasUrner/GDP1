## Interactive Card: Iteration

The final step of this project is to take your feedback from the previous two steps and use it to revise and improve your interactive card. Start by using the Remix button to make a copy of your project - then make your changes there.

### Learning Targets:

* I can revise work based on feedback from colleagues.

## Instructions

1. Meet with your reviewers and **make notes** about their feedback.
2. Decide on the changes that you need to make to your card.
3. Implement the changes and resubmit.

## Submission

Make a copy of the [submission template][template] and fill it out, describing the changes that you made to your interactive card. Submit on Canvas as usual.
