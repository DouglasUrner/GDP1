## Interactive Card: Iterate

The final step of this project is to take your feedback from the previous two steps and use it to revise and improve your interactive card.

### Learning Targets:

* I can revise work based on feedback from colleagues.

## Instructions

1. Meet with your reviewers and **make notes** about their feedback.
2. Decide on the changes that you need to make to your card.
3. Implement the changes and resubmit.

## Submission

Make a copy of the [submission template][template] and fill it out, describing the changes that you made to your interactive card. Submit on Canvas as usual.
