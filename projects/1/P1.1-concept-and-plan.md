## Interactive Card: Concept & Plan

After your know who you are creating your card for, and why, it is time to start picking (or designing) your sprites and planning the "interactivity" - by the end of this step you will know what your card look like and how it will you deliver your message?

### Learning Targets:

* I can create a design for a card that conveys a message.
* I can create a plan for the interactive elements of the card.
* I can apply Booleans and conditionals to plan how the interactive elements will work.

## Instructions

Once you have an approved concept for your card:

1. Add a new heading in your notes (with a date, of course).
1. Sketch out some ideas for the design of your card.
1. In the [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LoeIvbzAt7RjeQJTWd9ZIdEv-qhayf2uUisbEWnosA4/edit?usp=sharing), make a list of the sprites that you need (at least three).
1. Sketch out, or make notes, on the interactive elements of the card.
1. In the Google Doc, list the conditions that drive the interactive elements of the card.
1. Get your design signed off.

Use [U2L10b Planning Guide Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LoeIvbzAt7RjeQJTWd9ZIdEv-qhayf2uUisbEWnosA4/edit?usp=sharing) to collect your lists of sprites and interactions - you'll need to make a copy for yourself. (in the menu bar, choose File > Make a copy...).

## Submission

Make sure your design page is dated, that it has a descriptive heading, bookmark your design with a sticky note at the top of the page and turn in your notebook. In Canvas submit your Planning Guide.
