## Interactive Card Project

With **Booleans** and **conditionals** you now have the tools to control the behavior of a program that you design. For this project we will exercise those skills by creating an interactive card to share with someone you care about.

The projects has four phases:

1. Concept and Plan - Who are you creating the card for? What is the occasion? What message do you want the card to convey? What sprites do you need? How will they sprites interact? How will the recipient interact with the card?
1. Development - Creating your sprites and code in Game Lab.
1. Evaluate - Review two cards with their creators (and review your card with two people).
1. Iterate - Take your feedback from the previous step and use it to iterate on (revise) your design.

Each phase has a deliverable (and a corresponding assignment in the gradebook).

### Learning Targets:

* I can plan a project.
* I can use conditionals to react to keyboard input or changes in variables / properties.
* I can sequence commands to draw in the proper order.
* I can use the *counter pattern* to move a sprite smoothly.

## Project Phases

Do each phase in order and submit the corresponding assignment before moving on to the next phase.
