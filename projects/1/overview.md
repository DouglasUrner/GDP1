## Lesson 10: Interactive Card Project

With **Booleans** and **conditionals** you now have the tools to control the behavior of a program that you design. For this project we will exercise those skills by creating an interactive card to share with someone you care about.

The projects has four phases:

1. Concept development - Who are you creating the card for? What is the occasion? What message do you want the card to convey?
2. Design and planning - What sprites do you need? How will they sprites interact? How will the recipient interact with the card?
3. Development - Creating your sprites and code in Game Lab.
4. Evaluate - Review two cards with their creators (and review your card with two people).
5. Iterate - Take your feedback from the previous step and use it to iterate on (revise) your design.

Each phase has a deliverable (and a corresponding assignment in the gradebook).

### Learning Targets:

* I can use conditionals to react to keyboard input or changes in variables / properties
* I can sequence commands to draw in the proper order
* I can apply the **iterator pattern** to variables or properties in a loop

### The Iterator Pattern

## Project Phases
