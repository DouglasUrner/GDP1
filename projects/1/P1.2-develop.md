## Interactive Card: Development

[template]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b67aFB3g01nyqxXPzw86rm7ZNDp19lYy_T5j3nenugQ/edit?usp=sharing

Once you have your design sorted out and your sprites and interactions planned, it it time to start coding!

### Learning Targets:

* I can set sprites and associate animations with them.
* I can make sprites respond to user input.
* I can modify sprite properties in the draw loop to create animations.
* I can use variables and/or sprite properties to create conditional behaviors.
* I can apply the counter pattern to solve coding/design problems.
* I can create prompts to help the user interact with the card.

## Instructions

**After** you have an approved [concept and plan][concept], start coding your card using the [**Project Work**](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/4) steps (4-8) of [Lesson 14: Project - Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/1) on the Code.org site.

[concept]: https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1527538/assignments/11144591?module_item_id=22994855

The steps are:
1. [Laying out the background](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/4)
1. [Adding the sprites](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/5)
1. [Responding to user input](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/6)
1. [Other (surprise) conditionals](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/7), and
1. [Finishing touches](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/8)
