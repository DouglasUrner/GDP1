## Interactive Card: Develop

Once you have your design sorted out and your sprites and interactions planned, it it time to start coding!

### Learning Targets:

* I can set sprites and associate animations with them.
* I can make sprites respond to user input.
* I can modify sprite properties in the draw loop to create animations.
* I can use variables and/or sprite properties to create conditional behaviors.
* I can apply the counter pattern to solve coding/design problems.
* I can create prompts to help the user interact with the card.

## Instructions

**After** you have an approved [concept](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1404736/assignments/10111758?module_item_id=20868220) and [design](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1404736/assignments/10113076?module_item_id=20868717), start coding your card using the [**Project Work**](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/4) steps (4-8) of [Lesson 14: Project - Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/1) on the Code.org site.

The steps are:
1. [Laying out the background](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/4)
1. [Adding the sprites](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/5)
1. [Responding to user input](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/6)
1. [Other (surprise) conditionals](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/7), and
1. [Finishing touches](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/8)

## Submission

Once you have finished the first iteration of your card, be sure to click the Submit button on step 8 to finalize your submission.

Create a Google Doc and in it describe any differences between your design and your interactive card. Share your project (use the Share button next to the Code.org logo and include a link to your card in the document.

After clicking on the Submit button, use the Google Doc tab to select and attach your document.
