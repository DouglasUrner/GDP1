## FP 5: First Code Merge

Once the members of your team have developed their code, it is time to put the pieces together into a "complete" first prototype.

### Individually

By now you should have a complete (as in it has all of the pieces, even if they are minimal) version of the code for your contribution. If you don't your first priority should be on completing your contribution – focus on getting all of the pieces done, but not polished. For example, if you are doing game control having a simple mechanism to begin the game and start a new game is important, having nice buttons or a great animation is not as important (work on it if you have the basics implemented, but the basics should be done and working first).

### As A Team

The actual merging has to be done by the owner of the "released" project. If that person is absent or for some reason doesn't want to be the "driver" for the merge, then either start a new project or "remix" the existing project. In either case change the link in your breakdown document to point to the current "released" version of your team's project.

There are many ways to approach merging code. Here are some suggestions:

* Test often, very often.
  - If you are merging code into existing code in your team's released project, start by testing to find out the state of the project. Make sure it is working or that you understand what is "broken."
  - Make little changes, and test after *every* change.
* Know what you expect the changes you are making to do and have a way to test to see if they work as expected.
* Keep your code organized.

## Submission

Once you have your prototype complete:

1. Review the Work Breakdown document to ensure that it is up to date and that the links are working (try the links to the workspaces of the other members of your group – they should all take you to a Game Lab project, and when you use the view code button you should see a comment with a team member's name at the top of the file.
1. Then one member of the team should submit a PDF of the document.
