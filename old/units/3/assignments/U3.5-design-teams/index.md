# Design Teams

**As a special one-time offer you may select you partner today** (after class today, I will assign partners) - teams should be exactly two people.

Then start working on [Lessons 20: The Game Design Process](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/20/puzzle/1) and [21: Using the Game Design Process](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/21/puzzle/1) in Code.org.

Make a copy of the [template][], then complete and submit by the end of the period.

You can find the team lists here:
