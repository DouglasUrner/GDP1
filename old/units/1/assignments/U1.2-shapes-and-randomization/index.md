The name that JavaScript uses for the code element that we used to draw rectangles and elipses in the last lesson:

**rect(100, 100);**

is a ***function*** (other languages may use different terms, *procedure* and *method* are common). In the last lesson you saw how to change the ***parameters*** of the **rect()** and **elipse()** functions to change the location of the shape.

Today we're going to see how to change the size and proportions of the shapes as well.

## Instructions

1. Work through the steps of the lesson ([Computer Science Discoveries, Unit 3 Lesson 4](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/4/puzzle/1)) - Control-click on the link to open it in a new tab.
1. If you are finding that you need an additional challenge try some of the ideas below. Start with a design in your notes - can you think of a method (even if you can't figure out the code yet)?
1. For this assignment step 12 is used to assess your understanding â€“ be sure to complete this step.
1. Make a copy of the [submission template][template] and fill it out.
1. Once you've completed the template, submit it.

### Learning Targets:

* I can use the drawing commands with multiple parameters to create more complex and interesting shapes.
* I can generate and use random numbers to add variation to my shapes - to add interest and create more realistic scenes.

## Challenges

* If Game Lab didn't have a **background()** function, what other functions could you use to acheive the same result?
* In step 12 generate a random color.
* Use the **randomNumber()** function to create a realistic cloud. Vary the shape *and* the position of the cloud. Does the cloud look better if you also vary the color a bit? What are reasonable bounds on the parameters?
