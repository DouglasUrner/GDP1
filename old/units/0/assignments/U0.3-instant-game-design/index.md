## (Almost) Instant Game Design

Today we are going to create a quick prototype of a ***race to the finish*** game in four easy steps:

[Slides][slides] - right-click and choose **Open link in a new tab** to view.

### Learning Targets:

* I can explain the way the term ***pattern*** is used by game designers and computer scientists.
* I can describe the "race to the finish" pattern.
* I can explain why designers of electronic games often prototype them on paper.

## Instructions

### The Constraints:
* Use the race to the finish pattern
* Suitable for two (or more) players

### The Steps - in brief
1. Understand the "race to the finish" **pattern**.
2. Find a narrative.
3. Decide how to race.
4. Add conflict.

The full instructions are on [the handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZRybnTi7oD4AgrY_1ax-MAQXkqkocGvlqawwnpknLVM/edit?usp=sharing).

**Use a full blank page in your notebook for the design. Before you turn your notebook in, bookmark your design with a sticky note at the top if the page.**

### Playtest

After creating you game test your game with a partner (ideally) or two. Divide up the time so that each designer's game is tested. As you test **make notes** about your rules and how the game works. In your notes identify the playtest notes with a new heading.

Things to note:
* Who tested your game.
* Places where you needed to clarify or revise the rules.
* Changes that you made to the game.
* Ideas for cards or special squares (if you use either of them).
* Ideas for how to make the game more engaging for the players.

### Reflection Questions - In your notebook

After testing your game:
* What made your game **fun** (or if it really, truely, wasn't any fun at all - what was missing)? And, 
* What could you change to make the game more fun?

## Submission

The work that is assessed for this assignment is in your notebook - be sure that you have:
1. Dated your page(s) for today's work.
1. Given your page a heading (perhaps the name of your game or "Instant Game Design."
1. Have the game board in your notes.
1. Have your playtest notes clearly identified.
1. Responded to both reflection questions.
1. Bookmarked the first page of you instant game design with a sticky note on the **top** of the page:
   - 2nd Block: please use a **blue** sticky note.
   - 7th Block: please use a **yellow** sticky note.
