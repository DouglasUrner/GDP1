## Lesson 9: Sprite Movement

After exploring variables and the **counter pattern** in the previous lesson, the first part of this lesson should feel like a review, you may skip ahead to the second part if you're comfortable with applying the counter pattern to manipulate sprites. The second part, starting with step **9: Debugging with Watchers**, will be new for most of us. Be sure to take eough time to understand what is going on here. The debugger is your friend!

### Learning Targets:

* I can identify which sprite properties need to be changed, and in what way, to achieve a specific movement.
* I can use the counter pattern to increment or decrement sprite properties and acheive a desired movement.
