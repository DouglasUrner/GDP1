## Interactive Card Project

With **Booleans** and **conditionals** you now have the tools to control the behavior of a program that you design. For this project we will exercise those skills by creating an interactive card to share with someone you care about.

The projects has four phases:

1. [Concept and Plan][plan] - Who are you creating the card for? What is the occasion? What message do you want the card to convey? What sprites do you need? How will they sprites interact? How will the recipient interact with the card?
1. [Development][] - Creating your sprites and code in Game Lab.
1. [Evaluation][] - Review two cards with their creators (and review your card with two people).
1. [Iteration][] - Take your feedback from the previous step and use it to iterate on (revise) your design.

Each phase has a deliverable on Canvas (and a corresponding assignment in the grade book).
