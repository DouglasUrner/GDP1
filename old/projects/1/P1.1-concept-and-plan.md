## Interactive Card: Concept & Planning

Start off your work on the [Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/1) by developing your concept for the card. The project is to create a [interactive card](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/3) (you may also know these as eCards) for a person that you care about. It could be a thank you, a happy birthday, or anniversary, or perhaps the beginning of a hunt for some treasure. You could use the card to let the person know why they are important to you.

You will know that you've got it you can complete a sentence like this one "I want to tell ***name-goes-here*** that they matter to me because ***specific-and-detailed-reason-goes-here.***" For example - "I want to thank my grandmother for all of the summers when she made us corn fritters - and for letting me watch so that I could figure out how to make them for myself."

### Learning Targets:

* I can create a design for a card that conveys a message.
* I can create describe the interactive elements of the card.
* I can apply Booleans and conditionals to plan how the interactive elements will work.

## Instructions

The concept development and planning go in your notebook. You may find it helpful to refer to the [project guide][project-guide].

1. Start off with a dated page with a descriptive heading in your notebook.
1. Then review the rubric (below).
1. Brainstorm ***several*** ideas for who you could create a card for and what you would like to say to them. Make a list of the ideas that you come up with.
1. Review your ideas and decide which one you will use for this project (if you find it fun you could always do more than one - letting people know that they matter to you is always worth doing). You may want to pick a person who has access to, and uses, the Internet so that they can go back to their card and show *their* friends, but you could always show them on your device.
1. Once you know who you are making the card for:
   - Sketch some ideas for the "opening scene" of the card.
   - Sketch some ideas for the "final scene" of the card.
1. Describe how the recipient will interact with the card - will they click on something? Drag something with the mouse? Type something?
1. When you've got a concept show it to me for approval.

Once you have an approved plan, you can get started on the next step - [developing the code][develop] in Game Lab.

## Submission

Make sure your concept page is dated, that it has a descriptive heading, and that it has been stamped. Then **bookmark your concept with a sticky note at the top of the page** and turn in your notebook at the end of class.
