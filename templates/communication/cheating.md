As I was giving feedback on assignments today I noticed that [student]'s [name of assignment] assignment was almost identical to the one submitted by one of his classmates. I've spoken to [student]'s classmate about the assignment a few times, so I am reasonably confident about the authorship of the work.

Aside from the integrity issue, this means that [student] is missing the chance to test out the skill and understanding that we are trying to develop. I'm concerned that it is also a sign that [student] is struggling in my class and is either embarrassed to or doesn't know how to ask for help.

This assignment will be entered in the gradebook as a zero, but [student] will have the opportunity to demonstrate the skills this assignment assessed on later assignments. I'm available for extra help after school most days (expect on Tuesdays when we have meetings).

I'll be speaking to [student] about this next class, but I wanted to give you a heads up so that it wouldn't be a complete surprise to you or [student].
