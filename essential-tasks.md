**Driving Question:** How do designers develop the concept for an *interactive experience* and create testable digital prototypes to refine the design?

*Games* are one type of *interactive experience*, but the principles and skills that we are learning are not exclusive to games and so we do not limit ourselves to games.

**Essential Tasks:**

By the end of the semester you should be able to:

* Develop a concept for an interactive experience.
* Identify the core mechanic (mode of interaction) used in your concept.
* Create a digitial prototype to test your core mechanic.
* Document your design and the research and testing related to it.
* Collaborate with a diverse team on a project â€“ both in person and electronically.
* Describe possible career pathways in game (interactive experience) design and programming

**Associated Skills:**

In completing the essential tasks you will demonstrate these skills:

* Creating and managing shared documents.
* Tracking due dates and managing expectations.
