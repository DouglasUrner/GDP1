## Instructions

### The Constraints:
* Use the race to the finish pattern
* Suitable for two (or more) players

### The Steps - in brief
1. Understand the "race to the finish" **pattern**.
2. Find a narrative.

The full instructions are on [the handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZRybnTi7oD4AgrY_1ax-MAQXkqkocGvlqawwnpknLVM/edit?usp=sharing).

Use a full blank page in your notebook for the design. Before you turn your notebook in, bookmark your design with a sticky note at the top if the page.

### Playtest

After creating you game test your game with a partner (ideally) or two. Divide up the time so that each designer's game is tested. As you test make notes about your rules and how the game works.

### Reflection Question - In your notebook

After testing your game, what made your game **fun** or what could you change to make the game more fun?
