# Final Project

## Overview

Collaborate in teams of 3 or 4 to create a game design and to build a prototype in Game Lab.

The game ***must*** be based in local history, myth, or lore.

### Demonstrate

### Notebook

* __Documenting The Development Of An Idea__  
* __Tracking New Knowledge & Vocabulary While Learning A New Concept__  
* __Recording & Using The Information Necessary To Manage A Project__  

### Content Standards

* __Working With Sprites__  
* __Declaring & Using Variables__ 
* __Using Patterns__  
Define _pattern_ as the term is used in software engineering and show examples of their use. Describe and point to uses of patterns in the code that you wrote, e.g., the _counter pattern_.
* __Controlling Program Behavior With Conditionals__  
* __Defining Functions__  
* __Using Abstraction__  
Define _abstraction_ and explain why it is important in CS and software development. Point to Game Lab abstractions that you are using in your code, or that you have developed and used in your code.

### Industry Standards

* __Knowing The Qualities & Components Of Games__  
* __Using An Iterative Design Process__  
* __Testing Code To Ensure That It Works__
