## FP 6: Reflection

The final step in the project is to reflect on how it went.

### Individually

Make a copy (**File > Make a copy...**) of the [Final Project Reflection Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ElpMy5qJjl8QXDfFw3RkvGSh4VVGuu7Nc2flaN9rXzI/edit?usp=sharing) and respond to the reflection questions. Then submit the your document.

Play some of the other [final project games]() - click on the link to see the list.

## Submission

Review your document to ensure that it is complete and that the link to your individual code is working - the easiest way to check is to sign out of your Code.org account and then attempt to click on the link. It should take you to a "live" version of your code - **not to the Game Lab IDE.** If you do not get to your code, be sure that you are using a link from the share button on your project.
