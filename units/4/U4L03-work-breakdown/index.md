## FP: Plan & Work Breakdown

Your game prototype should include the following elements:

* A means of starting the shared game (a start button or similar mechanism within the game, the Run button in Game Lab is only visible in the IDE).
* An implementation of a core feature or mechanic that you want to test.
* Feedback to the user on their score / health / progress as appropriate for your game.
* Detection of win and/or lose states.
* A means of restarting the shared game so that player can play again (this is **not** the Reset button in Game Lab, that is to visible outside of the IDE).

Your objective in this assignment is to plan how your team will divide up the work of building your prototype and to set up a Google Doc to help you coordinate and have access to the work of your team mates.

### As A Team

1. Have one member of your team make a copy a of the [Work Breakdown Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iVBv_bE_cPIBlDf-J-iPFY7ZjVvKLgJgf_ss3V6Jaoo/edit?usp=sharing). 
1. Have one member create a new Game Lab project and name it using your game's name - this will be the "released" project where you merge working code contributions from your team members.
1. Add a brief description of your prototype in the **Game Description** box.
1. Finally, in the **Live Link** box, insert an *Anyone at South Kitsap School District with the link can comment* link to the document. This will allow me to see and comment on the live version of your team's work breakdown.

### Individually

Go to Google Drive and find the Work Breakdown Template that was shared with you. Add it to your Drive, then:
1. Create a Game Lab project for yourself.
1. Add your name in a comment at the top of the code.
1. Share your project and get a link to it.
1. Add your name as a **Team Member** in the **Project Milestones** section of the Work Breakdown.
1. In the **Contributions** column paste the link to your shared project in the **Workspace** box.
1. Describe the work on the game that you will be responsible for in the **Tasks** box.

## Submission

1. Review the [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iVBv_bE_cPIBlDf-J-iPFY7ZjVvKLgJgf_ss3V6Jaoo/edit?usp=sharing) to ensure that it is complete and that the links are working (try the links to the workspaces of the other members of your group – they should all take you to a Game Lab project, and when you use the view code button you should see a comment with a team member's name at the top of the file.
1. Then one member of the team should submit a PDF of the document.
