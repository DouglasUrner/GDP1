Go to Google Drive and find the Work Breakdown Template that was shared with you. Add it to your Drive, then:
1. 

## Submission

1. Review the [template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iVBv_bE_cPIBlDf-J-iPFY7ZjVvKLgJgf_ss3V6Jaoo/edit?usp=sharing) to ensure that it is complete and that the links are working (try the links to the workspaces of the other members of your group – they should all take you to a Game Lab project, and when you use the view code button you should see a comment with a team member's name at the top of the file.
1. Then one member of the team should submit a PDF of the document.
