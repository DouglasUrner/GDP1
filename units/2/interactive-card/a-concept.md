## A: Interactive Card Concept

Start off your work on the [Interactive Card](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/1?section_id=1750379) by developing your concept for the card. The project is to create a [interactive card](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/14/puzzle/3) (you may also know these as eCards) for a person that you care about. It could be a thank you, a happy birthday, or aniversery, or perhaps the beginning of a hunt for a present. You could use the card to let the person know why they are important to you.

You will know that you've got it you you can complete a sentance like this one "I want to tell ***name-goes-here*** that they matter to me because ***spccific-and-detailed-reason-goes-here.***" For example - "I want to thank my grandmother for all of the summers when she made us corn fritters - and for letting me watch so that I could figure out how to make them for myself."

### Learning Targets:

* I can develop and document a specific idea for a project.

## Instructions

The concept development and planning go in your notebook. You may find it helpful to refer to the [project guide on the Code.org site]().

1. Start off with a dated page with a descriptive heading.
1. Then review the rubric (below).
1. Brainstorm ***several*** ideas for who you could create a card for and what you would like to say to them.
1. Review your ideas and decide which one you will use for this project (if you find it fun you could always do more than one - it's a great time of year for letting people know that they matter to you). You may want to pick a person who has access to, and uses, the Internet so that they can go back to their card and show *their* friends, but you could always show them on your device.
1. When you've got a concept show it to me for approval.

Once you have an approved plan, you can get started on the next step - [the design and your plan for building the card](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1404736/assignments/10113076?module_item_id=20868717).

## Submission

Make sure your concept page is dated, that it has a descriptive heading, and that it has been signed off. Then bookmark your concept with a sticky note at the top of the page and turn in your notebook.
