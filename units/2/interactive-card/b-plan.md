## B: Interactice Card Plan

After your know who you are creating your card for, and why ([A: Interactive Card Concept](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1404736/assignments/10111758)), it is time to start picking (or designing) your sprites and planning the "interactivity" - by the end of this step you will know what your card look like and how it will you deliver your message?

### Learning Targets:

* I can create a design for a card that conveys a message.
* I can create a plan for the interactive elements of the card.
* I can apply Booleans and conditionals to plan how the interactive elements will work.

## Instructions

Once you have an approved concept for your card:

1. Add a new heading in your notes (with a date if it is a new day).
1. Sketch out some ideas for the design of your card.
1. Sketch out, or make notes, on the interactive elements of the card.
1. From your ideas, pull together the plan that your want to develop.
1. Get your design signed off.

You may use the [U2L10b Planning Guide Google Doc]() as a model, or you may create your own copy (in the menu bar, choose File > Make a copy...) and submit it electronically.

## Submission

Make sure your design page is dated, that it has a descriptive heading, and that it has been signed off. Then bookmark your design with a sticky note at the top of the page and turn in your notebook.
