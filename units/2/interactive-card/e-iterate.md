## E: Iterate

The final step of this project is to take your feedback from the previous two steps and use it to revise and improve your interactive card.

### Learning Targets:

* I can revise work based on feedback from colleagues.

## Instructions

1. Review your feedback from assignment U2L10c - Develop and U2L10d - Evaluate.
2. Decide on the changes that you need to make to your card.
3. Implement the changes and resubmit.

## Submission

Create a Google Doc and in it describe the changes that you made to your interactive card. Include in a link to the revised version of your card.
