## D: Evaluate

Before sending your card out into the world it would be a good idea to get some "unbiased" observers to take a look at it. They can help you spot typos, glitches in the interaction, or confusing parts of your design.

### Learning Targets:

* I can identify parts of my card that I want feedback on.
* I can give clear and specific feedback on a card that I have tested.

## Instructions

### As Designer

Use the [Code Review Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NDfkEjUnvuOulfhg7pOFeiSfc_4hECur1N7IB86OwH8/edit?usp=sharing) to create a checklist for your reviewers.

1. Find at least two people who will review your card - both should be people who are not familiar with your card and one **must** be. Add their names to the Google Doc for our class:

* [7th Block](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nEgvJF0CLUraTNgXfxBqNQjua5U7rYi6Ef37XvKWJFY/edit?usp=sharing)
* [8th Block](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vz4EKLSO6Xru8OFg-5a5UjUCHl8NigSYBYkUatuJ7yY/edit?usp=sharing)

1. Add a link to your card to the top of the document.

1. Review your card and look for areas where your would like feedback on the "user experience" (aka UX) of your card. Some typical examples are:
   - Could you tell how to get started?
   - Are the tasks clear?
   - Is the "pacing" right?
   - Can you get to the "surprise?"
   - Do you see any spelling mistakes or other design problems?
   
   You should come up with at least 6 areas for your reviewers to look at.
   
1. Share your the document with at least two reviewers - one of whom must be from a different row (you want "fresh eyes" looking at your project).
   
### As Reviewer

You will be reviewing **at least** two interactive cards. Ideally both of them will be "new to you" so that you can give the card designer feedback from a fresh point of view.

1. The designer will share a link to their Code Review document with you.

1. Make a copy of the document and add your name to the top.

1. Click on the link in the document and test out the card and respond to the designer's questions.

1. Click on the show code button and using the second half of the Code Review document review and give feedback on the code of the interactive card.

1. Return the document to the designer. 

## Submission

Designer: submit a PDF (File > Download as > PDF Document (.pdf)) of **each** review. You should be uploading at least two documents, one from each reviewer.
