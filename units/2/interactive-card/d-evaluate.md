## D: Evaluate

Before sending your card out into the world it would be a good idea to get some "unbiased" observers to take a look at it. They can help you spot typos, glitches in the interaction, or confusing parts of your design.

### Learning Targets:

* I can identify parts of my card that I want feedback on.
* I can give clear and specific feedback on a card that I have tested.

## Instructions

1. Review your card and look for areas where your would like feedback. Some typical examples are:
   - Is it clear to the recipient what they should do with the card?
   - Is the "pacing" right?
   - Can you get to the "surprise?"
   - Any spelling
