## Lesson 10: Interactive Card Project

With **Booleans** and **conditionals** you now have the tools to control the behavior of a program that you design. For this project we will exercise those skills by creating an interactive card to share with someone you care about.

The projects has four phases:

1. Concept development - Who are you creating the card for? What is the occasion? What message do you want the card to convey?
2. Design and planning - What sprites do you need? How will they sprites interact? How will the recipient interact with the card?
3. Development - Creating your sprites and code in Game Lab.
4. Test, review, iterate - Review two cards with their creators (and review your game with two people).

Each phase has a deliverable (and a corresponding assignment in the gradebook).

### Learning Targets:

* I can use conditionals to react to keyboard input or changes in variables / properties
* I can sequence commands to draw in the proper order
* I can apply the iterator pattern to variables or properties in a loop

### The Iterator Pattern

## Project Phases

Do each phase in order and submit the corresponding assignment before moving on to the next phase.

### A - Interactive Card Concept

### B - Design and Planning

### C - Development

### D - Test, Review, Iterate
