## Lesson 7: The Draw Loop

Work through the steps of the lesson  ([Computer Science Discoveries, Unit 3 Lesson 7 - The Draw Loop](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/7/puzzle/1)) - Control-click on the link to open it in a new tab, if you are finding that you need an additional challenge try some of the ideas below. Start with a design in your notes - can you think of a method (even if you can't figure out the code yet)?

### Learning Targets:

* I can explain what animations are, and how they create the illusion of smooth motion.
* I can explain how the draw loop allows for the creation of animations in Game Lab.
* I can use the draw loop in combination with the randomNumber() command, shapes, and sprites to make simple animations.

### Challenges

* In part 9, how could you make the brush move smoothly, as if an invisible hand were painting with it?
