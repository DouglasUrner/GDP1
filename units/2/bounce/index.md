## Title

In this project we are going to create a project that looks a bit like air hockey on a square table. It is a chance to practice breaking down a problem and turning it into managable – and testable – steps. We'll use this as an opportunity to develop the skill of designing a solution ***before*** we start coding it.

### Learning Targets:

* I can make a plan for developing a (relatively) simple program.
* I can identify milestones along the way to solving a bigger problem.
* I can list tests that will help me verify that my code is working as planned.
* I can use my notes to track ideas and to work out possible solutions.

### Deliverable

The assessment for this assignment will be based on the notes that you keep as you are working on creating your version of the code for this project. **Be sure to turn in your notebook after class.**

## Instructions

1. Start each entry in your notes with the date and a descriptive title. Anybody reading your notes should be able to tell at a glance what you were working on and when you made the notes.
1. Design **before** you code – practice helps to develop habits, so do this even if you think you can skip this step for this project. Use your notes to work out details before you try to code them.
1. End each day by reflecting on (and updating) your notes. Look for missing details. Write down questions that you need to ask. Update your list of milestones. Review your task list.

## Submission

On the due date bookmark the beginning of your notes with sticky and turn in your notebook.
