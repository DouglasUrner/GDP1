## Warm Up

In your notebook, start a page for today - date it and give it a title "Bounce" might work well...

Then watch the animation on the display at the back of the room - we're going to develop a plan and start building the code for it today. In your notes, describe what is happening - what is the animation doing.

Then describe what you could create now and what would be a puzzle to implement.
