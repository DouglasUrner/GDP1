## Program 1

```javascript
var width = 10
var height = 20 + width
```

What are the final values of **width** and **height**?

---

## Program 2

```javascript
var size = 30
size = 60
size = size + 5
```

What is the final value of **size**?

---

## Program 3

```javascript
var age = 11;
var height = 60;
age = age + 1;
height = height + 5;
```

What are the final values of **age** and **height**?

---

## Program 4

```javascript
var xPosition = 100
var yPosition = xPosition
xPosition = yPosition + 30
yPosition = yPosition + 50
```

What are the final values of **xPosition** and **yPosition**?

---

## Program 5

```javascript
var smiley = createSprite(100,200);
smiley.setAnimation(“smileyFace”);
drawSprites();
smiley.x = smiley.x + 50;
drawSprites();
```

On your handout, sketch the location(s) of the smileyFace sprite.

---

## Program 6

```javascript
var smiley = createSprite();
smiley.setAnimation(“smiley”);
smiley.x = 50;
smiley.y = 100;
drawSprites();
smiley.x = smiley.x + 50;
drawSprites();
smiley.x = smiley.x + 50;
drawSprites();
smiley.x = smiley.x + 50;
drawSprites();
```

On your handout, sketch the location(s) of the smileyFace sprite.

---

## Program 7

```javascript
var smiley = createSprite();
smiley.setAnimation(“smiley”);
smiley.x = 200;
smiley.y = 300;
drawSprites();
smiley.y = smiley.y - 30;
drawSprites();
smiley.y = smiley.y - 30;
drawSprites();
smiley.y = smiley.y - 30;
drawSprites();
```

On your handout, sketch the location(s) of the smileyFace sprite.

## The Counter Pattern

Note: reusable patterns are one of the big ideas of learning to program - well understood solutions to common problems that can be applied across a range of situations.

---

## Operators

In order of precedence:

|   | Operator | Operation |
|:-:|:-:       |---|
| P | **(** and **)** | Grouping |
|   | __.__ | Member access |
|   | __++__ and __--__ | Postfix increment and decrement |
| E | __**__  | Exponentiation |
| M and D | __*__ and **/** | |
| A and S | **+** and **-** | Addition and subtraction |

## Counter Pattern Project

Using what you have learned in Code.Org lessons 3-8, create a Game Lab project that "tells a simple story" - for example: they rowed the boat across the harbor. In the project you should make use of the **counter pattern** to have an object or objects moving in a realistic manner.

Start by planning your project in your notebook.
