## Warm Up

In your notebook, start a page for today - date it and give it a title "Bounce" might work well...

Then watch the animation on the display at the back of the room - we're going to develop a plan and start building the code for it today. In your notes, describe what is happening - what is the animation doing.

Then describe what you could create now and what would be a puzzle to implement.

## Challenges

* Bounce when the edge of the sprite hits the edge of the frame.
* Add a second sprite.
* Have sprites collide and bounce off of each other?

Make notes on your ideas, **then** try to code them.

## Testing

## Wrap Up

Review your notes, make sure:

* They are dated and have a title
* There is a clear "problem statement" - what are we trying to create and how does it behave?
* You have notes on your ideas for solutions.
  - How do you detect when the sprite reaches the edge?
  - How do you change direction?
  - What changes when you add movement on the Y-axis?
* Next steps
