## Lesson 11: Booleans & Conditionals

After the unplugged Booleans activity (Lesson 10) it is time to try our hands at having our programs make decisions. It "programmer speak" we're talking about the *flow of control* and *conditionals.* We want to be able to change the path through our code based on the conditions that exist. For example, we might want to reverse the direction of a sprite when it reaches the edge of the viewport or when it bumps into something.

Work through the steps of the lesson  ([Computer Science Discoveries, Unit 3 Lesson 11 - Conditionals](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/11/puzzle/1)) - Control-click on the link to open it in a new tab, if you are finding that you need an additional challenge try some of the ideas below. Start with a design in your notes - can you think of a method (even if you can't figure out the code yet)?

Before wrapping up, take a look at the [debugging steps in lesson 9](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/9/puzzle/9). The debugging skills you develop will serve you for the rest of your programming life (maybe even for the rest of your life period).

### Learning Targets:

* I can predict the output of simple boolean statements
* I can use conditionals to make my programs react to changes in variables and sprite properties

### Challenges

* Have a sprite change direction if it runs into an edge or another sprite.
