## Counter Pattern - Project Plan

Introduction/Overview

### Learning Targets:

* I can develop ideas for a small coding project.
* I can recognize applications for the **counter pattern** in ideas for animated scenes.

## Instructions

1. Start a new entry in your notes. Make sure you date it and give it a descriptive heading – "Counter Pattern Ideas" would make sense for this project.
2. Brainstorm some ideas for a simple animated scene that you could create in Game Lab. The scene should "tell a story" – for example, the cat chased a dog. See if you can come up with at least five ideas.
3. Look at your scene ideas and see if one of them would make use of the **counter pattern** or if any of them could be modified to use the **counter pattern.**
4. Pick an idea that uses the **counter pattern**. Indicate in your notes which idea you selected.

## Submission

Bookmark your notes from today with a sticky note on the top of the page and turn in your notebook at the end of the block.
