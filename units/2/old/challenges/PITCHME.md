## Warm Up:

What does this code fragment do?

```javascript
var xPos = randomNumber(100, 300);
fill(rgb(128, 128, 128, 0.5));
rect(xPos, 175);
```

Note:

What color will it be? Transparent middle gray.

## Agenda

* **Complete lessons 3-7 on Code.Org**

* **If You've Finished Lesson 7...**

Try one of these:

* Create a scene with "atmosphere" - for example a foggy day or a rain or snow storm.
* Put a "face" on the snake from Lesson 4 step 12 **and** have it move with the ellipse as the ellipse moves randomly.

Develop your ideas in your **notes,** then make a plan for how to test them out, finally create the scene as a new **Game Lab project**.

## Reflection: In your notebook

How would you make a sprite move around and around in a scene - like a fish in a fishbowl?

Sketch out your code in your notes and explain how it would work.
