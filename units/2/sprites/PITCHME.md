## Warm Up

Here is a hunk of code from the lesson on variables, Lesson 5 - it doesn't do what the author was trying to do...

'''javascript
var originX = 100;
var originY = 42;
var width = 50;
var height =
rect;originX, originY; width; height;
```

What do you think the author intended?

What seems wrong about this code?
