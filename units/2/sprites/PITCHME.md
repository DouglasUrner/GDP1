## Warm Up

Here is a hunk of code from the lesson on variables, Lesson 5 - it doesn't do what the author was trying to do. But there aren't any error messages on the console either...

```javascript
var originX = 100;
var originY = 42;
var width = 50;
var height =
rect;originX, originY; width; height;
```

What do you think the author intended?

What seems wrong about this code? Make a list of things to try in your notes.

How would you suggest that they change it?
