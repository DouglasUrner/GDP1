## Lesson 5: Variables

Work through the steps of the lesson  ([Computer Science Discoveries, Unit 3 Lesson 5 - Variables](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/5/puzzle/1)) - Control-click on the link to open it in a new tab, if you are finding that you need an additional challenge try some of the ideas below. Start with a design in your notes - can you think of a method (even if you can't figure out the code yet)?

### Learning Targets:

* I can explain variables and describe how they are used to label and reference values in a program.
* I can use variables in a program to store a piece of information that will be used multiple times.
* I can figure out and fix common errors encountered when using variables in my programs.
