## If You've Completed Lesson 7...

Try one of these:

* Create a scene with "atmosphere" - for example a foggy day or a rain or snow storm.
* Research how you could move a sprite smoothly, then add "traffic" to a scene.
* Create scene that shows the passage of time.
* Put a "face" on the snake from Lesson 4 step 12 **and** have it move with the ellipse as the ellipse moves randomly.
