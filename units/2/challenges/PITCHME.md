## Warm Up:

What do these code fragments do?

**var xPos = randomNumber(100, 300);**

**fill(rgb(128, 128, 128, 0.5));**

Note:

What color will it be? Transparent middle gray.

# Agenda

### Complete lessons 3-7 on Code.Org

### If You've Finished Lesson 7...

Try one of these:

* Create a scene with "atmosphere" - for example a foggy day or a rain or snow storm.
* Create scene that shows the passage of time (sun rising and setting, snow accumulating, etc.).
* Put a "face" on the snake from Lesson 4 step 12 **and** have it move with the ellipse as the ellipse moves randomly.

Develop your ideas in your **notes,** then make a plan for how to test them out, finally create the scene as a new **Game Lab project**.

## Reflection: In your notebook

How would you make a sprite move around and around in a scene - like a fish in a fishbowl?

Sketch out your code in your notes and explain how it would work.
