## CSD Lessons 12 & 13: Keyboard Input and Other Forms of Input

Work through the steps of the lessons  ([Computer Science Discoveries, Unit 3 Lesson 12 - Keyboard Input](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/12/puzzle/1)) and ([Computer Science Discoveries, Unit 3 Lesson 13 - Other Froms of Input](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/13/puzzle/1))- Control-click on the link to open it in a new tab, if you are finding that you need an additional challenge try some of the ideas below. Start with a design in your notes - can you think of a method (even if you can't figure out the code yet)?

As you work on your code, take some time to practice with the debugger (see the [debugging steps in lesson 9](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/9/puzzle/9)) to look at your Boolean (true/false) variablse. As your conditionals get more complex debugging skill becomes increasingly useful.

### Learning Targets:

* I can use conditionals to react to keyboard input
* I can move sprites in response to keyboard input
* I can use an else statement as the fallback case to an if statement
* I can differentiate between conditions that are true once per interaction, and those that remain true through the duration of an interaction.

### Challenges

* Detect if a sprite represents an ally, an opponont, or a neutral entity. This will take some research and planning.
