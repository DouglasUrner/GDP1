[Slides: The **draw()** loop][slides] - right-click and choose **Open link in a new tab** to view.

### Learning Targets:

* I can explain what a *loop* is.
* I can explain what animations are, and how they create the illusion of smooth motion.
* I can explain how looping the **draw()** function allows us to animate scenes in Game Lab.
* I can use the draw() function in combination with randomNumber(), shapes, and sprites to make simple animations.

## Instructions

1. Work through the steps of the lesson ([Computer Science Discoveries, Unit 3 Lesson 7 - The Draw Loop](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/7/puzzle/1)) - Control-click on the link to open it in a new tab.
1. For this assignment steps [9](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/7/puzzle/9) and [10](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/7/puzzle/10) are used to assess your understanding â€“ so please be sure to complete both steps.
1. Make a copy of the [submission template][template] and fill it out.
1. Once you've completed the template, submit it.

### Challenges

* In part 9, how could you make the brush move smoothly, as if an invisible hand were painting with it? At this point, I don't expect you to be able to code this, but can you explain why the brush jumps around? Any ideas for how to turn the bouncing movement into a smooth stroke?

## Submission

After completing your [template][], submit a PDF through Canvas - **do not** submit by sharing the document.
