# Shapes, Parameters, and Random Numbers

The formal name for code like the code that we used to draw rectangles and elipses in the last lesson:

**rect(100, 100);**

is a ***function*** (or a *procedure* or a *method*). In the last lesson you saw how to change the ***parameters*** of the **rect()** and **elipse()** functions to change the location of the shape.

Today we're going to see how to change the size and proportions of the shapes as well.

## Lesson 4: Shapes and Randomization

Work through the steps of the lesson, if you are finding that you need an additional challenge try some of the ideas below. Start with a design in your notes - can you think of a method (even if you can't figure out the code yet)?

## Challenges

* In step 8 make the cloud look more "cloudlike".
* In step 12 generate a random color.
* Use the randomNumber() function to create a realistic cloud. Vary the shape *and* position of the cloud. Does it look better if you also vary the color a bit? What are reasonable bounds on your parameters?
