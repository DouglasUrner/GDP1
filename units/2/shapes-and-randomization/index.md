# Shapes, Parameters, and Random Numbers

The name that JavaScript uses for the code element that we used to draw rectangles and elipses in the last lesson:

**rect(100, 100);**

is a ***function*** (other languages may use different terms, *procedure* and *method* are common). In the last lesson you saw how to change the ***parameters*** of the **rect()** and **elipse()** functions to change the location of the shape.

Today we're going to see how to change the size and proportions of the shapes as well.

## Lesson 4: Shapes and Randomization

Work through the steps of the lesson ([Computer Science Discoveries, Unit 3 Lesson 4](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/4/puzzle/1)) - Control-click on the link to open it in a new tab, if you are finding that you need an additional challenge try some of the ideas below. Start with a design in your notes - can you think of a method (even if you can't figure out the code yet)?

### Learning Targets:

* I can use the drawing commands with multiple parameters to create more complex and interesting shapes.
* I can generate and use random numbers to add variation to my shapes - to add interest and create more realistic scenes.

## Challenges

* Make a background without using the **background()** function.
* In step 8 make the cloud look more "cloudlike".
* In step 12 generate a random color.
* Use the randomNumber() function to create a realistic cloud. Vary the shape *and* position of the cloud. Does it look better if you also vary the color a bit? What are reasonable bounds on your parameters?
