### Learning Targets:

* I can create a variable and assign a sprite to it.
* I can use dot notation to access and change a sprite's properties
* I can design and create a static scene combining sprites, shapes, and text.

## Instructions

1. Work through the steps of the lesson ([Computer Science Discoveries, Unit 3 Lesson 6 - Sprites](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/6/puzzle/1)) - Control-click on the link to open it in a new tab.
1. If you are finding that you would like an additional challenge try some of the ideas below. Start with a design in your notes - can you think of a method (even if you can't figure out the code yet)?
1. For this assignment steps 14 and 18 are used to assess your understanding â€“ so be sure to complete both steps.
1. Make a copy of the [submission template][template], add your link and screen capture, then answer the questions.
1. Once you've completed the template, submit it.

### Self-checks



### Challenges

* What properties do you think a sprite might have? Do some research and see if you can discover other game engines and the properties of their sprites.
* Does *dot notation* support properties of properties? For example, could the image you attach to a sprite with **setAnimation()** have properties of its own, say the name of its creator or copyright information? How do you *think* you might get at that information?
* How do you change the font used to display text? What properties does the text have?

## Submission

After completing your [template][], submit a PDF through Canvas - **do not** submit by sharing the document.
