## Lesson 6: Sprites

Work through the steps of the lesson, if you are finding that you need an additional challenge try some of the ideas below. Start with a design in your notes - can you think of a method (even if you can't figure out the code yet)?

### Learning Targets:

* I can create a variable and assign a sprite to it.
* I can use dot notation to access and change a sprite's properties
* I can design and create a static scene combining sprites, shapes, and text.

### Challenges

* What properties do you think a sprite might have? Do some research and see if you can discover other game engines and the properties of their sprites.
* Does *dot notation* support properties of properties? For example, could the image you attach to a sprite with **setAnimation()** have properties of its own, say the name of its creator or copyright information? How do you *think* you might get at that information?
* How do you change the font used to display text? What properties does the text have?
