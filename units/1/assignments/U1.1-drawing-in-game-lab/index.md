To get started with programming in JavaScript, we'll learn how to create simple images in Game Lab using the **rect()** and **ellipse()** drawing functions.

[Slides: Drawing In Game Lab][slides] - right-click and choose **Open link in a new tab** to view.

### Learning Targets

* I can use the Game Lab IDE (*Integrated Development Environment*) to plot different colored shapes on the screen.
* I can sequence code correctly to overlay shapes so that they produce the desired effect.
* I can debug code written by others.

## Instructions

Work through all 10 sections of [Computer Science Discoveries Unit3 Lesson 3: Drawing in Game Lab](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/3/puzzle/1) - Control-click on the link to open it in a new tab. Visit the informational pages so that you know what is there and try out the challenges.

## Challenges

* Display colors that are not in the **fill()** funtion's dropdown menu.
* Explain how to create different shades of gray (including black and white).

## Submission

Submit a **window** screen capture of the Lesson Extras page for Lesson 3, showing the progress bar at the top and your creation (be sure to run in so that the output of your code is visible).
