Code.org's Game Lab is an *IDE (**I**ntegated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment)* that was developed to teach game development and programming skills using the [JavaScript][] programming language. JavaScript is a commonly used language that is implemented in most web browesers. When you click on a button on a website you are probably causing some JavaScript code to run. 

To get started with with Game Lab and JavaScript, we'll learn how to create simple images using the **rect()** and **ellipse()** drawing functions.
