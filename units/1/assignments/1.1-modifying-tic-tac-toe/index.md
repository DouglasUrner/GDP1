## Summary
Analyze Tic-Tac-Toe and then redesign the game by changing a few rules.

## Goals
* Understand that small changes to game mechanics can have a large impact on the system of a game.
* Practice using the iterative process.
* Get to know some of your coleagues.

## Understand the Mechanics

1. Develop a common understanding of the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe - I'll write them on the board, but you should also be reconding them in your notes.
1. Why is Tic-Tac-Toe a "solved problem?"
1. What changes could we make to make the game more engaging and challenging - to increase the "meaningfulness" of the player's decisions?

Then discuss why Tic-Tac-Toe always ends in a draw for most players. Have the class brainstorm what they might modify in order to change the game: the grid size and shape, the number of players, the winning conditions, the things you can do on a turn, etc.

## Modify!
Pairs of students try to redesign the game in order to increase the space of possibility of the game – to make it more interesting to play than the “solved problem” of classic Tic-Tac-Toe.

As they design, have them change as little as possible – one, two, or three rules at the most. They should follow the iterative process of making small changes, playing their modified version, analyzing how they affected the game, and then redesigning again.

Finally, groups can share their modifications with the class, and what did and didn’t work. If there are too many groups for everyone to share, then pairs of groups can play each others’ games and discuss.
