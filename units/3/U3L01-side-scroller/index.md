## U3L1: Side Scroller Game

In this lesson we are going to start our investigation of one of the "big ideas" in computer science - **abstraction.** We'll be looking at how abstractions can make our code simpler and easier to read.

### Learning Targets:

* I can use the **sprite.velocityX**, **sprite.velocityY**, and the **sprite.rotationSpeed** properties to create and change sprite movements
* I can describe the advantages of simplifying code by using "higher level"  blocks (**abstractions**).
* I can use the **sprite.isTouching()** block to determine when two sprites are touching.
* I can explain how **abstractions** help to manage the complexity of code.

### Deliverable

For this lesson you will create a **Side Scroller** game and submit a copy of the [U3L01 Submission Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gVR-eagLCPBAyVarJJRZTLyHFCMPr59zQ4gQ2l_RFQ8/edit?usp=sharing) with a link to your game.

## Instructions

1. On Code.org work through [Lesson 15: Velocity](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/15/puzzle/1).
1. Then, go on to [Lesson 16: Collision Detection](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/16/puzzle/1).
1. Once you have completed the [Side Scroller](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/15/puzzle/11) - including the score challenge from [Step 10 of Lesson 16](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/16/puzzle/10), share, and add a link to the template.
1. Submit your copy of the template.

## Submission

Review your copy of the template to ensure that it is complete and that the link is working. Then submit a PDF of to document.
