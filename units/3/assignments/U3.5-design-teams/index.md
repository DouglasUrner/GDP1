Select you partner - teams should be exactly two people, then start working on [Lessons 20](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/20/puzzle/1) and [21](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/21/puzzle/1) in Code.org.

Make a copy of the [template][], then complete and submit by the end of the period.
