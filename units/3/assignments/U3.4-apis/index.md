API is an acronym for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface - an API is a set of objects, methods, and properties that define how a system of code (or part of a system of code) works. In the [slides][] the methods ```drawClouds()``` and ```drawTrees()``` could be the beginning of an API for creating landscapes. You can probably imagine other methods that could be added as well, perhaps ```drawBush()```, ```drawBoulder()```, etc.

To be generally useful an API needs to provide the programmer with some flexibility - for example where to place the trees or the clouds. A good API documents an abstraction, or a set of abstractions that make it easier to think about the code you are writing - and easier to read it later on.

### Learning Targets:

* I can explain what the term **API** means to a programmer.
* I can propose methods (functions) to include in a simple API

## Instructions

For this assignment you will be improving and extending an API for drawing landscape elements in Game Lab.

1. After finishing [Lesson 19: Functions](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/19/puzzle/1) find 1 or 2 partners to work with on an API.
1. Start by sketching a simple landscape - trees, flowers, clouds, etc. Have each person make a sketch. Compare the sketches and make a list of the elements that you each used. Note what is different about them (those differences might mean that they are "different objects" - say a pine tree vs. an oak tree - or they can help you see where you need parameters - for example, to specify the location of a tree or a boulder).
1. Each item in your landscape represents an element of your API. Divide up the elements so that each member of your group has at least two functions to write.
1. After you write your functions, share them with your team members - on easy way to do this is to copy and paste them into a Google Doc.
1. Then, using your API, create the landscape that you sketched in the **[Lesson Extras](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/19/extras) step of Lesson 19.
1. Make a copy of the [submission template][template] and fill it out.
1. Once you've completed the template, submit it.

## Submission

After completing your [template][], submit a PDF through Canvas - **do not** submit by sharing the document.
