API is an acronym for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface - an API is a set of objects, methods, and properties that define how a system of code (or part of a system of code) works. In the [slides][] the methods ```drawClouds()``` and ```drawTrees()``` could be the beginning of an API for creating landscapes. You can probably imagine other methods that could be added as well, perhaps ```drawBush()```, ```drawBoulder()```, etc.

To be generally useful an API needs to provide the programmer with some flexibility - for example where to place the trees or the clouds. A good API documents an abstraction, or a set of abstractions that make it easier to think about the code you are writing - and easier to read it later on.

### Learning Targets:

* I can explain what the term **API** means to a programmer.
* I can propose methods (functions) to include in a simple API

## Instructions

For this assignment you will be improving and extending an API for drawing landscape elements in Game Lab.

1. On Code.org work through [Lesson 19: Functions](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/19/puzzle/1) to complete your Collector game. Step 11 is used for assessment - be sure to complete it.
1. Make a copy of the [submission template][template] and fill it out.
1. Once you've completed the template, submit it.

## Submission

After completing your [template][], submit a PDF through Canvas - **do not** submit by sharing the document.
