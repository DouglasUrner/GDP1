## Game Lab Physics & the Flyer Game

Using the **velocity abstraction** and the **counter pattern** we'll simulate accelerations and gravity (which anyone who has taken physics will tell you is just an acceleration...). Then we will move on to collisions.

### Learning Targets:

* I can use the sprite velocity properties with the counter pattern to create different types of sprite movement.
* I can use the `displace`, `collide`, `bounce`, and `bounceOff` blocks to produce sprite interactions.
* I can explain how simple programming constructs can be combined to create complex behaviors.
* I can give examples of how new abstractions can be built top of existing abstractions.

## Instructions

1. On Code.org work through [Lesson 17: Complex Sprite Movement](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/17/puzzle/1).
1. Then, go on to [Lesson 18: Collisions](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/18/puzzle/1).
1. Once you have completed the [Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/18/puzzle/8) - including at least one improvement from [Step 13 of Lesson 18](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/18/puzzle/13), share, and add a link to the template.
1. Make a copy of the [submission template][template] and fill it out.
1. Once you've completed the template, submit it.

## Submission

After completing your [template][], submit a PDF through Canvas - **do not** submit by sharing the document.
