## U3L3: Functions

Functions help you manage complex code by abstracting operations into **functions** that handle tasks for you. In this assignment you'll start writing functions.

### Learning Targets:

* I can explain what the term **function** means to a computer scientist.

### Deliverable

For this lesson you will submit a copy of the [U3L03 Submission Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-0IvE0nlNj4Pv73nHS21bWDkRmPsuB9TkNhq_5LTzNA/edit?usp=sharing)
with a shared link to your version of the **Collector Game**.

## Instructions

1. On Code.org work through [Lesson 19: Functions](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/19/puzzle/1).
1. Once you have completed the [Collector Game](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/19/puzzle/9), share, and add a link to the template.
1. Submit your copy of the template.

## Submission

Review your copy of the template to ensure that it is complete and that the link is working. Then submit a PDF of to document.
