## U3L1: Abstractions 1 - Velocity & Collision Detection

In this lesson we are going to start our investigation of one of the "big ideas" in computer science - **abstraction.** We'll be looking at how abstractions can make our code simpler and easier to read.

### Learning Targets:

* I can explain what the term **abstraction** means to computer scientists and why it is a "big idea."
* I can give examples of abstraction in everyday life.
* I can explain how **velocity** and **collision detection** are examples of abstraction in game programming.
* I can use **abstraction** and **collision detection** to make my code simpler and easier to understand.

### Deliverable

For this lesson you will submit a copy of the [Google Doc Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gVR-eagLCPBAyVarJJRZTLyHFCMPr59zQ4gQ2l_RFQ8/edit?usp=sharing) with links to your version of the **Side Scroller** game.

## Instructions

1. On Code.org work through [Lesson 15: Velocity](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/15/puzzle/1).
1. Then, go on to [Lesson 16: Collision Detection](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/16/puzzle/1).
1. Once you have completed the [Side Scroller](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/15/puzzle/11) - including the score challenge from Step 10 of Lesson 16](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/16/puzzle/10), share, and add a link to the template.
1. Submite your copy of the template.

## Submission

Review your copy of the template to ensure that it is complete and that the link is working. Then submit a PDF of to document.
