## U3L1: Abstractions - Velocity & Collision Detection

In this lesson we are going to start our investigation of one of the "big ideas" in computer science - **abstraction.**

### Learning Targets:

* I can explain what the term **abstraction** means to computer scientists and why it is a "big idea."
* I can give examples of abstraction in everyday life.
* I can explain how **velocity** and **collision detection** are examples of abstraction in game programming.
* I can use **abstraction** and **collision detection** to make my code simpler and easier to understand.

### Deliverable

For this lesson you will submit a copy of the [Google Doc Template]() with links to your work on Code.org.

## Instructions

1. On Code.org work through [Lesson 15: Velocity]().
1. Then, go on to [Lesson 16: Collision Detection]().
1. Once you have completed the [Side Scroller]() - including the score challenge from Step 10 of Lesson 16](), share, and add a link to the template.
1. Submite your copy of the template.

## Submission

Review your copy of the template to ensure that it is complete and that the link is working. Then submit a PDF of to document.
