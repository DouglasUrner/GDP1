## U3L2: Abstractions 2 - Complex Sprite Movement & Collisions

Using the **velocity abstraction** and the **counter pattern** we'll simulate accelerations and gravity (which anyone who has taken physics will tell you is just an acceleration...).

### Learning Targets:

* I can explain what the term **abstraction** means to computer scientists and why it is a "big idea."
* I can give examples of abstraction in everyday life.
* I can explain how **velocity** and **collision detection** are examples of abstraction in game programming.
* I can use **abstraction** and **collision detection** to make my code simpler and easier to understand.

### Deliverable

For this lesson you will submit a copy of the [U3L02 Submission Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XTNK5uS6JM7RbFnPWlXCvYuKNisIWtH2Lfzc9q-WiiY/edit?usp=sharing) with a shared link to your version of the **Flyer Game**.

## Instructions

1. On Code.org work through [Lesson 17: Complex Sprite Movement](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/17/puzzle/1).
1. Then, go on to [Lesson 18: Collisions](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/18/puzzle/1).
1. Once you have completed the [Flyer Game](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/15/puzzle/8) - including at least one improvement from Step 13 of Lesson 18](https://studio.code.org/s/csd3-2018/stage/18/puzzle/13), share, and add a link to the template.
1. Submit your copy of the template.

## Submission

Review your copy of the template to ensure that it is complete and that the link is working. Then submit a PDF of to document.
